  - **Problem 1:** 
    - **Title:** Array Declaration
      - **Details:** Learn the syntax and semantics of declaring arrays in various programming languages. Arrays are used to store multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations, facilitating efficient data access and manipulation.

  - **Problem 2:** 
    - **Title:** Array Delete Operation In Unsorted Array
      - **Details:** Implement a function to delete a specified element from an unsorted array while maintaining the order of other elements. This operation involves searching for the element and shifting subsequent elements to fill the gap created by the deletion.

  - **Problem 3:** 
    - **Title:** Array Insert At Any Position In Unsorted Array
      - **Details:** Explore techniques to insert an element at any given position in an unsorted array. This operation requires shifting elements to accommodate the new element at the desired position.

  - **Problem 4:** 
    - **Title:** Array Insert At The End In Unsorted Array
      - **Details:** Understand how to efficiently insert an element at the end of an unsorted array. This operation involves appending the new element to the end of the array.

  - **Problem 5:** 
    - **Title:** Array Left Rotation Approach 1 Using Temp Array
      - **Details:** Implement a function to left rotate an array by a specified number of positions using a temporary array. This approach involves copying elements to the temporary array and then copying them back to the original array with the required shift.

  - **Problem 6:** 
    - **Title:** Array Left Rotation Approach 2 - Rotate One By One
      - **Details:** Explore another approach to left rotate an array by rotating elements one by one. This method involves repeatedly shifting elements to the left by one position until the desired rotation is achieved.

  - **Problem 7:** 
    - **Title:** Array Right Rotation Approach 1 Using Formula Basis
      - **Details:** Understand how to perform a right rotation on an array using a mathematical formula-based approach. This method calculates the new position of each element after the rotation.

  - **Problem 8:** 
    - **Title:** Array Right Rotation Approach 2 Using Reversing The Array
      - **Details:** Implement a function to right rotate an array by reversing it and then reversing specific segments. This approach involves reversing the entire array and then reversing the segments before and after the pivot point.
      
  - **Problem 9:** 
    - **Title:** Array Right Rotation Approach 3 Using Recursive Approach
      - **Details:** Explore a recursive approach to perform a right rotation on an array. This method recursively swaps elements to achieve the desired rotation.
      
  - **Problem 10:** 
    - **Title:** Delete In Sorted Array
      - **Details:** Implement a function to delete a specified element from a sorted array while maintaining the sorted order. This operation involves shifting elements to fill the gap created by the deletion.
      
  - **Problem 11:** 
    - **Title:** Insert In Sorted Array
      - **Details:** Learn techniques to insert an element into a sorted array while keeping the array sorted. This operation requires finding the correct position for the new element and shifting elements as necessary.
      
  - **Problem 12:** 
    - **Title:** Reverse Array Approach 1 - Array Reverse Using an Extra Array (Non In-place)
      - **Details:** Implement a function to reverse an array using an extra array, thus not modifying the original array. This approach creates a new array with elements in reverse order.
      
  - **Problem 13:** 
    - **Title:** Reverse Array Approach 2 - Array Reverse Using a Loop (In-place)
      - **Details:** Learn an in-place approach to reverse an array using a loop. This method swaps elements from both ends of the array until they meet in the middle.
      
  - **Problem 14:** 
    - **Title:** Reverse Array Approach 3 - Array Reverse Inbuilt Methods
      - **Details:** Utilize inbuilt methods or functions to reverse an array available in some programming languages. This approach leverages built-in functions to perform the reversal operation.
      
  - **Problem 15:** 
    - **Title:** Reverse Array Approach 4 - Array Reverse Recursion (In-place or Non In-place)
      - **Details:** Explore a recursive approach to reverse an array, which may or may not be in-place depending on the implementation. This method recursively swaps elements to achieve the reversal.
      
  - **Problem 16:** 
    - **Title:** Reverse Array Approach 5 - Array Reverse Stack (Non In-place)
      - **Details:** Learn how to use a stack data structure to reverse an array without modifying the original array. This approach involves pushing array elements onto a stack and then popping them to reverse the order.
      
  - **Problem 17:** 
    - **Title:** Search In Sorted Array
      - **Details:** Implement a function to search for a specified element in a sorted array efficiently using techniques like binary search. This method halves the search space in each iteration, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.
      
  - **Problem 18:** 
    - **Title:** Search In Unsorted Array
      - **Details:** Explore methods for searching elements in an unsorted array efficiently. This operation typically involves traversing the array sequentially until the desired element is found.
